# Virtual Coin Toss

This project is a **Virtual Coin Toss** simulation built using Python. The program allows users to flip a virtual coin multiple times, track results, and interactively repeat the process.

## 📌 Project Objectives

1. Simulate a random coin toss resulting in either "Heads" or "Tails".
2. Allow users to specify the number of flips they want to perform.
3. Track and display the count and percentage of "Heads" and "Tails".
4. Provide an interactive experience where users can repeat the simulation.

## 📂 Project Structure

```

```

## 🛠️ Requirements

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. You can check your version with:

```bash
python --version
```

## 🚀 How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd virtual-coin-toss
```

2. Run the Python script.

```bash
python virtual_coin_toss.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to simulate coin flips.

## 📊 Example Output

```
Welcome to the Virtual Coin Toss Program!
Enter the number of coin flips: 5
Result: Heads
Result: Tails
Result: Heads
Result: Heads
Result: Tails

Results:
Total Flips: 5
Heads: 3 (60.00%)
Tails: 2 (40.00%)

Do you want to toss again? (yes/no): no
Thank you for using the Virtual Coin Toss Program!
```

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Randomization**: Uses Python's `random.choice()` for fair coin toss results.
- **Interactive Input**: Users can specify the number of flips and decide whether to repeat the simulation.
- **Result Tracking**: Displays the total number of heads and tails with percentages.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

1. Understand how to use the `random` module for generating random outcomes.
2. Enhance your ability to use loops and counters for iterative tasks.
3. Improve user interaction handling through input and output prompts.
4. Gain experience in building interactive terminal-based programs.

## 🎯 Bonus Challenge (Optional)

- Add a graphical representation using Python's **tkinter** module.
- Track and display historical results across multiple sessions.
